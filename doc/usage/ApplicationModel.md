# Application Model

<img src="../images/architecture-model.png" style="float: right; padding: 10px">
Having all your application state in a single model may seem like a daunting design task, but it's not really that different from designing a hierarchical UI
layout. If you are used to having a distributed state between different stores and components, take some time to sit down and redesign the model as a single
hierarchy.

As the model has to be immutable, it makes sense to build it out of case classes. This provides us with many benefits down the line, such as pattern matching
and use of the `copy` method. For illustration purposes we'll define a simple case class hierarchy to represent the application model.

```scala
case class Root(a: A, b: B, c: String)
case class A(d: Int, e: String)
case class B(f: Boolean, g: Option[D])
case class D(h: Seq[Int], i: Int)

object AppCircuit extends Circuit[Root] { ... }
```

Making modifications to an immutable model means making a copy of the model every time something changes. Naturally we'll want to modify only those parts of the
hierarchy that we absolutely need to, leaving the rest as it is. These changes can be visualized as below:
![Hierarchy](../images/model-updates.png)

1. We want to change `B.f` to `false`
2. To implement the change, we must also change `b` and `root` objects with <br/>`root = root.copy(b = root.b.copy(f = false))`
3. Next we want to change `A.e` to `"normal"`
4. To implement this change, we must also change `a` and `root` with <br/>`root = root.copy(a = root.a.copy(e = "normal"))`

All the other parts of the model hierarchy stay the same throughout these changes, so your render code can skip re-rendering `root.b.g` for example.

## Accessing the Model

In Diode your application model is safely tucked inside the Circuit class, without any direct access. Instead you will get _indirect_ access via readers and
writers. These are defined as `ModelR` and `ModelRW` traits.

For example if your view needs to render the string `e` in class `A`, it doesn't care where that data comes from as long as it has access to it. Furthermore,
since the state changes always create a new root model, we cannot simply give the current value and expect that to work in the future. What we need is a chain
of functions going from `root` all the way to the piece of data we are interested in. The classes implementing `ModelR` and `ModelRW` provide this. To build a
reader to `root.a.e` we would write:

```scala
val reader: ModelR[Root, String] = new RootModelR(root).zoom(_.a.e)
```

To get the current value from the reader we simply call `reader.value`.

The `Circuit` provides `zoom` and `zoomRW` functions to zoom into the application model, so we can rewrite the previous example as:

```scala
val reader: ModelR[Root, String] = AppCircuit.zoom(_.a.e)
```

Note that you don't need to specify the types for the readers, they are automatically inferred. They are displayed here for clarity.

### Reference Equality

An important benefit of an immutable model is the use of _reference equality_ to quickly check if anything has changed. There is no need for expensive shallow
or deep equality checks to find out a change anywhere in the model. You can simply compare the previous and current value returned by an appropriate
`ModelR.value` using `eq` or `ne` operators. In case your reader returns a `AnyVal` value (like a `Double` or `Boolean`), you should use regular `==` and
`!=` instead.

Reference equality is mostly important in views where a decision whether to re-render a view must be made very efficiently. In the _action handlers_ checking
for changes is rarely needed.

### `Option` and Other Containers in the Model

When the model contains an `Option` or another container (for example [`Pot`](../advanced/Pot.md) for async data) and you want to access the contained data,
the reader needs to be constructed a bit differently. A naive approach is to use `map` in the `zoom` function to map over the container. For example to access
the sequence of `Int`s in `D` we could use something like

```scala
val reader: ModelR[Root, Option[Seq[Int]]] = AppCircuit.zoom(_.b.g.map(_.h))
assert(reader.value ne reader.value)
```

This works just fine for retrieving the value, but it breaks reference equality as the `map` function recreates the resulting `Option`. This means that every
call to `reader.value` returns a different instance. To work around this issue Diode provides special readers that cache container reference and update
it only when the content of the container changes. Use `map`, `flatMap`, `zoomMap` and `zoomFlatMap` to create such readers.

```scala
val reader: ModelR[Root, Option[Seq[Int]]] = AppCircuit.zoomMap(_.b.g)(_.h)
assert(reader.value eq reader.value)
```

Containers must support `map`, `flatMap` and (reference) equality check for the content to be compatible with Diode. In practice these readers require a _Monad_
type class to be implicitly available for the container type. Diode provides monads for `Option` and `Pot`. If you use some other containers, you must provide
the monad yourself. The type class interface is defined in `diode.Monad` and the implementation consists of just `map`, `flatMap` and `isEqual` methods.

Note that the above is only necessary if you want to maintain efficient reference equality checking. If your code doesn't need this, it's better to just use
the naive approach with a plain `zoom` call.

### Complex Access Patterns

We are not limited to traversing the hierarchy to get a reader for just a single value. Since we get to define the access function ourselves, we can freely
access anything in the model and return a composite.

```scala
val complexReader: ModelR[Root, (String, Boolean)] = 
  AppCircuit.zoom(r => (r.a.e, r.b.f))
```

Note that a reader like this will not support correct reference equality, because the tuple is recreated every time the reader is accessed. You may `zip` two
readers together to form a reader returning a tuple that preserves reference equality (the tuple is only updated when its constituents change).

```scala
val zipReader: ModelR[Root, (String, Int)] = reader.zip(AppCircuit.zoom(_.a.d))
```

This helps detaching the application model from the UI hierarchy, as you can keep your data in a sensible structure while allowing your UI components to access
it in a natural way.

### References within the Model

The application model being immutable, it makes sense to have a _normalized_ data model where a single piece of data occurs only in a single place within the
model. For example if your model has `ProductGroup`s consisting of `Product`s but a product can belong to multiple groups, the group should hold only references
to the product data, not the data itself.

In Diode context a reference to a value of type `V` would be `ModelR[_, V]` but that provides no update mechanism. To facilitate easy referencing of other data
within the model, Diode provides a `RefTo` class.

```scala
class RefTo[V](val target: ModelR[_, V], val updated: V => AnyRef) {
  def apply() = target()
}
```

It combines a model reader with a function to generate an update action for this particular reference. Using the Product example above, the model would be 
defined as

```scala
case class RootModel(products: Map[String, Product], productGroups: Map[String, ProductGroup])

case class Product(id: String, ...)

case class ProductGroup(id: String, products: Seq[RefTo[Product]], ...)

// action to update a product
case class UpdateProduct(id: String, newProduct: Product)

var model = RootModel(...)
val rootReader = new RootModelR(model)

// create a reference to a Product
def productRef(id: String) = RefTo(rootReader.zoom(_.products(id), UpdateProduct(id, _))
```

The `RefTo` paradigm is especially useful with Diode's [async collections](../advanced/PotCollection.md) as you can easily reference data that has not yet
been loaded into the client, but will be as soon as the reference is accessed. References can also be cyclic (which would be impossible in a normal immutable
hierarchy), meaning a Product can have a reference (or several) back to ProductGroup(s).

## Modifications through Writers

The `ModelRW` trait adds functionality to update the model. In addition to providing a function for reading a value, it requires a second function
for updating.

```scala
val rwForA: ModelRW[Root, A] = AppCircuit.zoomRW(_.a)((m, v) => m.copy(a = v))
val rwForA_e: ModelRW[Root, String] = rwForA.zoomRW(_.e)((a, v) => a.copy(e = v))
```

This time we are defining the writer in two steps to take advantage of the provided function composition. To make the update, just call `updated`.

```scala
val newRoot: Root = rwForA_e.updated("New value!")
```
Since `Circuit` doesn't allow us to change the internal model directly, we are just storing a copy for demonstration purposes. Only way to make actual changes
to the model is to dispatch and handle [actions](Actions.md).
